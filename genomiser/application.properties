### hg38 assembly ###
# To enable analysis of samples called against the hg38 assembly copy the hg19 above and just replace the hg19 with hg38
exomiser.hg38.data-version=1805
#transcript source will default to ensembl. Can define as ucsc/ensembl/refseq
exomiser.hg38.transcript-source=refseq

#location of CADD/REMM Tabix files - you will need these for analysis of non-coding variants.
#CADD can be downloaded from http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/download - v1.3 has been tested.
#REMM can be downloaded from https://charite.github.io/software-remm-score.html
#local frequencies are required to be normalised in the same manner as the input VCF and frequency values must be percentages.
#
#You will require the tsv.gz and tsv.gz.tbi (tabix) file pairs.
#Un-comment and add the full path to the relevant tsv.gz files if you want to enable these.

### caching ###
#If you're running exomiser in batch mode there might be some performance benefit
#if you enable caching. The 'simple' option will continue to store data in memory *without*
#limit - this means for really long-running batch jobs and/or whole genomes you may run out of memory.
#If this is likely choose the caffeine option and uncomment spring.cache.caffeine.spec and adjust the cache size
#to your requirements
#none/simple/caffeine
spring.cache.type=none
spring.cache.caffeine.spec=maximumSize=60000
