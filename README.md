This repository is made for processing Next-Generation Sequencing data in Korean with inherited retinal diseases.

The repository consisted of two main sequencing strategy.
1) whole exome sequencing
2) whole genome sequencing

Each part has three components.
a. SNPs + Indel
b. CNV (copy number variations)
c. SV (structural variations)

Whole exome sequencing was done with IDT xGen Exome Research Panel V1.0 with HiSeq2000.
Whole genome sequencing was done with PCR-free protocol.
